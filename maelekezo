First of all, i dont want app.js everything should be done in server.js
Now lets make sequelize migrations for all tables and their columns just make them up
Make all the essential auth methods in controller and routes
Complete the backend by adding controllers, routes, and middleware for all features (tasks, inventory, invoices,User,Language)

I thought the background on the login page was deep purple, and sidebar in dashboard is purple dont you think?

On the dashboard, looks like 
the top left corner has logo "enrep.sys"
Followed by a search bar still on the left
Then on the top right end there are icons chat,bell,settings and user icons
Lets implement this i'm not sure whether it is called navigation bar OR Header

----------------------------
The content Section has two section/row
The first top section/row has 5 card on display and an arrow(#D4ADFC color) to scroll to the next cards
Each card has 3 rows of text, a bold random number(#461B93 color), a unit(#8253D7 color) and The title below(black)

The second section/row (White background while its cards are ##f5f6fa) has two rows/section
The first on top has first card(##f5f6fa color) with barchart with thin bar with rounded corners, second card(##f5f6fa color) has 3x2 cards(#D4ADFC) with various icons 
The second row/section has first card(##f5f6fa color) with 2 column "Stock number" list of "Low stock item   12", "Item categories   6", "Refunded items   3" and the second card(##f5f6fa color) 
has 4 column "Store list" i.e "Arusha   20-employees  100-items  2-orders","Arusha   20-employees  100-items  2-orders","Arusha   20-employees  100-items  2-orders",

------------------------------
In scrollable contet The bottom section should occupy the visible width between the sidebar and scrollbar
The add product and log out buttons should just be like text buttons and they should be at the bottom
And the side menu should have icons before every menu [Home,Products,Categories,Stores,Finances,Settings,add product,log out]
Remember to leave good space between menus

--------------------------------------
Make the icons on header,text Logo and outline of search field and it placeholder/label to have (#6A3CBC color)
The background on the login page should be (#461B93) and the form should have no card & elevation, Just place everything horizontally center and start after 1/4 vertically from the top 
Also sidebar in dashboard is (#8253D7 color, And its menus and icons are white, While its menu hovered it turns  #461B93)

---------------------------------
In the Login
The login fields & button should be white, and button text should be like the page background
The logo should be white at the center 
And you should increase the width of fields and button a bit
And whole form from Logo to button should occupy the bottom 3/4 of the screen and leave space on top 1/4 of screen

-------------------------------------------
In dashboard the sidebar should have rounded corners 
-------------------------------------------
Actually in this products page content section
Ontop it has Page name "Products", Followed by search field(White with #6A3CBC for lebel/placeholder and icon) ,Followed by Filter by dropdown(#CDC1FF color but text has #461B93), Followed by Add Product button(#461B93 with white color for text and icon)
Below it has a table with headers[Name of product, status, stock info,category,Location] and each header is followed by sort icon. This is has top border(#8253D7) and bottom border(#6A3CBC)
Then in table content/body
First column has checkbox(#6A3CBC), Small Image with rounded corners and a Name
Second column has a Text sorounded by a rounded badge its either Active(#8253D7) sold out(#461B93) or Low in stock(#6A3CBC)
Third column stock info like "12 in stock","10 in stock","2 in stock", if it is "0 in stock"Then text appear faded/inactive for all the columns
Fourth column display categories either T-shhirt,Top,Outwear,Accessories, Bottoms, Dresses
Fifth column display either Store 2,Store 1, Store 4, Store 3 

Once you click on a certain item from the table, it opens a screen to display its item details, While maintaining header and sidebar
on top it has Product name/title
Below it it has text "Last update, date and time"
Below it it has a section with white backgroud, And on top this section is a section sorounded by a rounded border(#461B93) and it has two columns, 
The left [column it display a [row that has two [columns
[The first column is an image with rounded corners,
The second columns has Name,Brand,empty Space,Available sizes, Categories,Gender]]], Then below it has a row that has two columns, The first column display a barcode, the second column display product code and order name]
The right column has a row on top that Display Delete(outlined round button) and Edit product(#461B93), Then below is a borderless table with the title Store availability and has 2 columns, Then has 4 rows/entries ,[Store 1 => check mark(Icon), Store 2 => check mark(Icon), store 3 => red cross(Icon), store 4 = > check mark(Icon)]

Correct the following..
-In Stores
The scrollable content has white background, it has search field, filter by and add store button just like the Products page
Below that it has horizontal list of store cards(#f5f6fa) with picture and name
Once a card is selected it display its details by showing a card/div with rounded corners border(#6A3CBC) And this card/div has a close button on top right corner. I has Title/name, List of its multiple pictures with rounded corners, And a row with two columns looks like
Employees: 11     Most sold items: Unisex T-shirt Block
Items: 291        Most popular category: T-shirts
Orders: 1         Customer satisfaction: 89%
Refunds: 0        Status: Open

-Add Product
It has white background, Row with Two columns, The first column has [name,description,category,price] the second column has [item code, stock size,stores availability,product photos]
Thes save product button comes below at the center

-Finances
it has white background, on top it has "view range" dropdown date filter then the dates on range like "February 2022 - March 2024"
After this It comes 3 div/cards [net sales,gross profit,margin] each sorounded by border with color(#6A3CBC). These displays barcharts with rounded bars on top and bottom
Lastly it has a card(#f5f6fa background) spaning the whole width it can get, it has barchart "revenue breakdown", each bar has multiple data and multiple color sections, They are also rounded on top and bottom. Data presented are [bottoms,t-shirt,tops,accessories,jeans] 

-Settings
In here you just need to rearange the contents
personalInfo - Should split its content into two columns  
roleSection ans permissionsSection should be on the same row and each one to take its column
permissionsSection - should appear in this fashion
                      VIEW      EDIT       CREATE       APPROVAL
Customer   FaCheck    toggle    toggle     toggle       toggle

Supplier   FaCheck    toggle    toggle     toggle       toggle 
Store      FaCheck    toggle    toggle     toggle       toggle

I'm at the point where i want to test sending notification(both to single individual, few(2) and all users). So help me to structure it from timetable/page.js

Here are some of the codes,
backend/server.js


backend/notificationRoute.js


backend/model/notification.js


backend/service/notificationService.js


backend/taskController.js


frontend/src/app/lib/websocketcontext.js
